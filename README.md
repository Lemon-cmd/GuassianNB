# Guassian NB C++ Implementation   

This implementation is using the ***Iris Dataset***

**Guassian Naive Bayes Classifier** is a type of NB that only deals with features that have continuous values.  

***If you are using a different dataset, you must understand your data and how each feature relate to the classes***. 

### How does it works? ###
The classifier calculates the mean value and standard deviation of each feature(X) in relation to class (k). 
It applies this equation to each given test input to calculate probability:



### How to use? ###   
***You can simply run the bash script for building and running the code.***

**Boolean Multinominal NB** : ***Still in progress***
